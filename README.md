# ⚽ FIFA 22 Player Attributes - Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview
This project performs a complete **data analysis and visualization** of the **Top 650 FIFA 22 players** dataset.  
It demonstrates the full end-to-end **data analysis pipeline** using Python — from cleaning and preprocessing to statistical exploration and visual storytelling.

## 🎯 Objective
To uncover trends and patterns among FIFA 22 players by analyzing their physical, technical, and mental attributes, and visualize how these attributes influence their overall performance.

## 🧩 Dataset Details
- **Source:** Public FIFA 22 dataset (Opendatabay)
- **Records:** 650+
- **Columns:** 12+
- **Attributes:** overall, pace, shooting, passing, dribbling, defending, physic, etc.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code**

## 📊 Key Analyses & Visualizations
- Distribution of player overall ratings
- Age vs Overall rating correlation
- Position-wise performance comparison
- Preferred foot distribution
- Attribute correlation heatmap
- Nationality-wise average overall rating

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Most players have an overall rating between **70–85**.  
- Technical attributes (`dribbling`, `passing`, `shooting`) strongly correlate with overall rating.  
- Majority of players are **right-footed**.  
- Players aged **22–29** dominate the top-performing range.  
- Nations like **Brazil, France, Spain, and Argentina** have higher average player ratings.

## 🏁 Conclusion
